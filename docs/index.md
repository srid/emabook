# Emanote

Welcome to [Emanote][gh], which aims to be next-gen [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/) with powerful features.

Emanote is still a **work in progress**; therefore this site does not yet have much useful content.

Checkout [[start]]. Some doc hints are available in [[guide]], but nothing is fleshed out yet. If you are interested in contributing, see [[architecture]].
