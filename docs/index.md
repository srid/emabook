# Emanote

:::{.text-xl .leading-relaxed .my-6}
[Emanote][gh] enables you to **create beautiful websites** -- such as *personal webpage*, *blog*, *wiki*, *Zettelkasten*, *notebook*, *knowledge-base*, *documentation*, etc. from future-proof **plain-text notes** and arbitrary data -- with live preview that updates in real-time. It aims to be next-gen [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/) with powerful features.
:::

[Emanote][gh] is a **work in progress**. It is not yet ready for public use, but you may give it a test drive and give feedback to shape its development. See [[examples|websites using Emanote]].

Start from [[start]]. [[guide]] will eventually contain documentation, but for now checkout the [[demo]]. If you are interested in contributing, see [[architecture]].
