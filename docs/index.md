# Emanote

:::{.text-xl .my-4}
[Emanote][gh] enables you to **create beautiful websites** -- such as *personal webpage*, *blog*, *wiki*, *Zettelkasten*, *notebook*, *knowledge-base*, *documentation*, etc. from future-proof **plain-text notes** and arbitrary data -- with live preview that updates in real-time. It aims to be next-gen [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/) with powerful features.
