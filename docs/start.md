# Getting Started

WIP, but for now:

- Follow the [README on GitHub](https://github.com/srid/emanote#emanote) to install Emanote
- Use your existing notebook, or create one from [emanote-template](https://github.com/srid/emanote-template)
  - If using emanote-template, open the notebook in [[vscode]] and install the recommended extensions.
- Run `PORT=8080 emanote` on that notebook
  - Or `mkdir /tmp/output; emanote gen /tmp/output` to generate static files
