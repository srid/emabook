# Migrating from neuron

TODO 

Neuron notes should mostly work, except for the below:

- `z:zettels` => Obsidian-style queries
- Full path based URLs (unless `slug` is set)

Capabilities Emanote provides, but neuron does not:

- Live server with hot reload
- Flexible wikilins (link to directories, or based on path, eg: `[[Foo/Bar]]`)
- Full theming (customize HTML fully)
- YAML based configuration at per-route level
- Layers (merge Zettelkastens, or overlay them)
