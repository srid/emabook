# Open Graph Protocol (OGP)

The [Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me/) specifies what goes in `<meta>` attributes of the HTML which in turn generates "preview cards" for social sites and apps like X.com, Facebook, Slack, etc.

Emanote generates OGP meta tags for each note, using the following rules:

| Meta tag         | How the value is determinec          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `og:title`       | The title of the note                |
| `og:description` | The first paragraph of the note[^wl] |
| `og:site_name`   | The site name from [[yaml-config\|page.siteTitle]] |
| `og:type` | `website` |
| `og:image` | The first image[^img] in the note, if any; otherwise, use the `image` [[yaml-config\|YAML metadata]] |

## Twitter

[Twitter Card](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/overview/abouts-cards) style can be set using `page.twitter.card` [[yaml-config|YAML metadata]]. It it set to `summary_large_image` by default.

[^wl]: Wikilinks like `[[foo]]` render *as is* (due to a limitation). However, `[[foo|some text]]` will render as `some text` (the link text). If you do not wish to have wikilink syntax appearing in page description, specify a custom like in the second example.

[^img]: Unfortunately, embed wikilinks (eg.: `![[foo.jpeg]]`) are not recognized here. You should use regular links, eg.: `![](foo.jpeg)`.
