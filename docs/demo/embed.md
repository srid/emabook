# Embedding

You can embed files or notes, using `![[..]]` which is inspired by [Obsidian syntax](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Embed+files).

Embedding a note will simply inline it. For example, using `![[start]]` displays the following:

![[start]]

Embedding of [[file-links]], as indicated in the aforementioned Obsidian help page, will eventually be supported; embedding image files already work (`![[foo.jpg]]` is equivalent to `![](path/to/foo.jpeg))`.
