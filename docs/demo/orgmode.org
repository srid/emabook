* Org Mode 
Emanote provides first-class support for [[file:markdown.md][Markdown]]. But it also supports secondary formats (albeit not necessarily with the same level of support) beginning with [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]].

**WARNING**: This is a ==ðŸ§ª beta ðŸ§ª== feature and may change in future. It is being made available so users can try it out and give feedback to the author.

** Linking
Org Mode has no notion of wiki-links, but you can use =file:= [[https://orgmode.org/guide/Hyperlinks.html][hyperlinks]] to link to other files such as Markdown files. If you wish to link to a .org file from a Markdown file, however, regular wiki-links ought to work.
** Limitations
