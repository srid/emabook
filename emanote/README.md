Emanote emanates[^def] a structured view of your plain-text notes.

[^def]: **emanate**: *(of something abstract but perceptible) issue or spread out from (a source)*

Create beautiful websites -- such as personal webpage, blog, wiki, Zettelkasten, notebook, knowledge-base, documentation, etc. from future-proof plain-text notes and arbitrary data -- with live preview that updates in real-time.

Emanote is spiritual successor to [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page) based on [Ema](https://ema.srid.ca).

## Installing and using

## Developing


Emanote is a Haskell software.[^licenses] Thanks to Nix, this repository is pre-configured to provide a delightful development experience with full IDE support in Visual Studio Code. 

See https://srid.ca/haskell-template/start for complete instructions, but the tldr is: Install nix, enable Flakes and run `bin/run`.

See [architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for a high-level overview of the codebase.
